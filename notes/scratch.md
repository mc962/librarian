- Use a 'wizard' for creating/updating codelets
    - First page is the basic fields
        - name
        - description
    - Next page is the more involved 'examples' fields 
        - examples
            - command
            - output
            - comment

- If doing a 'wizard' it might be a fun idea to do it with react since most of the setup is already there
